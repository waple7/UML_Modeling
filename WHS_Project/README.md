**Warehouse Management System (WHS)** is designed to optimize the processes of receiving goods from suppliers, storing them in a warehouse, and shipping them to the company's branches. The warehouse manager places orders with suppliers, after which employees accept deliveries and place goods in the warehouse using the
information system. The system automatically determines the optimal storage location for each product. In addition, the manager accepts
requests from branches to receive goods, and the system automatically generates shipments if there are enough goods in the warehouse.
This allows you to optimize stocks and speed up the process of delivering goods to customers.
